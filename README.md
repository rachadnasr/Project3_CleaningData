# Project3_CleaningData : New Markets Data

## Team 

Rachad and Cl√©mence

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to combine data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas in a real dataset, and show some highlights after the cleaning. 

## Steps Followed 

- Load the data: excel file
- Analyze the data and create a plan for data preparation

- Use python to create function in order to follow the cleaning steps:
-- Cleaning Text and Removing Special Characters
-- Check ou the type of data and change if needed
-- Check for missing values and fill them if needed 
-- Check the dupliactes in IDs and put the ID as index 
-- Check for low variance columns and possible outliers (check ou the 0)
-- Check the incoherence between columns: "Age and Profession", "Age and Work experience", "Graduated and Profession"
-- Check out the Var_1 column containing different categories and figure out what these categories are based on
-- Export the cleaned table from Python to Mysql and store it as csv file

- Mysql analysis part:
-- Queries to load and work on the data 
-- Relationship between:
--- study the profile of most and least spenders: age, gender, profession and work experience
--- Evaluate the profession based on gender 
--- Evaluate the spending by the marital status 
--- Evaluate gender / marital status / work experience
--- Evaluate gender / marital status / spendings 

## Obstacles encountered 

## Lessons learned 

## Deliverables
- CSV file with clean data containing the results of our data wrangling work.
- Python file containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of our data set.
- MySQL queries file containing the code to obtain table of our analysis.
- A README.md file containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of our data as well as our results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.
